This project is a landing page created using vanilla CSS and HTML. The landing page design was inspired by a Figma design.


## What I learned
- implemented it using my custom utility CSS classes
- using variables in CSS
- got familiar with pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- created a custom checkbox
- became more familiar with CSS positioning properties like `absolute` and `relative`


## Overview
- **HTML**: HTML structure  is built according to  Figma design. Layout is created using semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`, providing accessibility and SEO-friendliness.

- **CSS**:  custom tility classes  were created to follow DRY.
