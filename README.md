This project is a landing page created using vanilla CSS and HTML. The landing page design was inspired by a Figma design.


## What I learned
- implemented it using my custom utility CSS classes
- using variables in CSS
- got familiar with pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- created a custom checkbox
- became more familiar with CSS positioning properties like `absolute` and `relative`



- **HTML**: The HTML structure of the landing page is built according to the design from Figma. The layout is created using semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`, ensuring accessibility and SEO-friendliness.

- **CSS**: The custom CSS styles were developed to match the Figma design. These styles are organized using utility classes, which makes it easier to apply consistent styling across the page. The use of variables in CSS helps in maintaining a consistent color scheme throughout the project.

- **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements**: Pseudo-classes, like `:hover` and `:active`, are used to create interactive elements and enhance the user experience. Pseudo-elements, such as `::before` and `::after`, are used for decorative and structural purposes.

- **Flexbox Layout**: Flexbox is heavily used to achieve a responsive and well-structured layout. This allows for easy positioning and alignment of elements within different sections of the landing page.

- **Custom Checkbox**: A custom-styled checkbox has been created, enhancing the visual appeal of form elements.

- **Positioning**: I gained familiarity with CSS positioning properties, including `position: absolute` and `position: relative`, to achieve precise control over element placement.
